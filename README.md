# Splunk-Cyber-Lab
Splunk SIEM Lab on Linux Server with Active Directory on Windows Server. Windows PC as a vulnerable machine and Kali Linux to attack purposes 

Oracle VM Virtual Box - Implementation of Splunk SIEM, Active Directory, Target Windows Machine, and Attacker Kali Linux virtual Instances

Overview
The source of this information is from Steven on YouTube via the channel DFIR. In his video, he explains in great detail how to create the lab and where to get all the resources. He even provides a troubleshooting guide for those who need it. I decided that I wanted to learn how to more effectively use Splunk as a SIEM. To begin I will provide screenshots of each of the 4 machines. After this, I will demonstrate how I used the Crowbar tool within Kali Linux to attack the Virtual Windows PC. Next, I will show a screenshot of how I queried the information using the Splunk Web Interface. This will be the first commit with other attacks as well as Splunk queries to help identify security issues. Finally, I will teach myself how to write up a remote on the incidents to gain experience in this crucial aspect of cybersecurity work.
